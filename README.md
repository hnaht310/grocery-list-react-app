### Grocery list app
The app was built with React using useState and useEffect hooks. Users can add a new item, edit an item, and delete an item.
Different kinds of alert will display depending on user's action. For example, when an item has been added to the list, an alert will be displayed on screen informing the user it has been processed successfully.
Alert will disappear after 2 seconds.
